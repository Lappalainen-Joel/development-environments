# Vagrant virtual machines as for development and testing environments.

## Machines:
  debian-dev01 - apache, mysql, php

## Description
Idea of these virtual machines is to easily deploy testing environment for projects.
I've tried to leave all role-variables as much default as possible.

- Listed all used roles variables in group_vars/<machine_name>, so that
  they can be managed from a single place easily.

- Ideal situation is that you just input project git-url, deploy machine and
  everything works.
  (Surely we can agree that this is not going to be the case most of the times.)

- To keep developing simple, virtual machines' /srv/sites -folder is shared
  to this git directory's folder shared_folders. This requires guest-additions
  for virtual machine. debian/jessie64 -box does not have this by default,
  and need to be installed for shared folder to work.

### debian-dev01:
  Set-up development environment for Laravel, or Set-up developing/testing
  machine for existing PHP-project.
